# Angry-Drain
Game made with processing, gonna be horrible

——————————————————————————————————————— <br>
This game is made with the processing IDE.
<br>
Angry Drain is my first proper game. <br>
prcocessing is not a game engine, <br>
so I figure if I can make a game in this, I can make one in **anything**. <br>

#### This game has a few goals:
◌ Up to 4 player multiplayer <br>
◌ At least 3 different enemies <br>
◌ Final boss <br> 
◌ Loot / inventory <br>
◌ Basic UI <br>
<br>
#### And if I'm able I want to add:
◌ Animations <br>
◌ Enemy AI <br>
◌ A shop <br>
◌ Levels <br>
<br>
