Game made with processing, gonna be horrible
***
## Game concept
The game's name was randomly generated by processing, and will in some way be impactful to the gameplay later on.

The game will be a top down zelda like rougelike, where you go through a dungeon and fight enemies. <br>
The reason I'm making this using processing, and not something like godot or even a raw openGL java project; <br>
is because my teacher doesn't let us use anything else for the exam. And so I figured that I might as well <br>
become a processing pro, by making a game in it. <br>

## Goals 
This game has a few goals I want to achieve.

#### General game
- A win condition
- Rougelike aspects such as getting points while playing and spending them in a shop after the game\
- weapon variety (at least 4)
- A boss
#### Game feel and stability
- Save files
- A working options screen
- Sound effects
- particles
#### Server
- 4 player multiplayer
- server specificity (having a host code)
