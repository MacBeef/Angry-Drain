Game made with processing, gonna be horrible

## Angry Drain the game
------------------------
This game is made with the processing IDE.

Angry Drain is my first proper game.
prcocessing is not a game engine, 
so I figure if I can make a game in this, I can make one in anything.

#### This game has a few goals:
◌ Up to 4 player multiplayer
◌ At least 3 different enemies
◌ Final boss
◌ Loot / inventory
◌ Basic UI 

#### And if I'm able I want to add:
◌ Animations
◌ Enemy AI
◌ A shop
◌ Levels
